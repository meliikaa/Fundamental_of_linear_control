# Fundamental_of_linear_control
**Overview**

Welcome to the "Fundamentals of Linear Control" repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to linear control tools commonly used in the field of control engineering. Here, you will find resources and simulation models developed in MATLAB and Simulink to understand key concepts like root locus, feedback loops, PID tuning, Nyquist plots, stability margins, and step response for various control systems.

**Introduction**

Control engineering is a critical discipline that deals with designing and analyzing systems to achieve desired behavior and stability. The "Fundamentals of Linear Control" project aims to provide a structured approach to understanding and applying various linear control tools to real-world control problems.

This repository serves as a learning resource for students, researchers, and anyone interested in gaining practical insights into linear control techniques.

**Linear Control Tools**

In this project, you will find detailed explanations and examples of the following linear control tools:

Root Locus: Understanding and plotting root loci to analyze system stability and design controllers.

Feedback Loops: Designing feedback loops for closed-loop control systems and evaluating their performance.

PID Tuner: Utilizing the built-in PID tuner in MATLAB for tuning proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers.

Nyquist Plots: Plotting Nyquist diagrams to assess system stability and robustness

Stability Margins: Calculating and interpreting stability margins (e.g., gain margin, phase margin) for feedback systems.

Step Response: Analyzing the step response of systems to assess performance and transient behavior.
